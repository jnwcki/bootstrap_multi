Basic Django website with multiple views and Bootstrap css

This was our weekend assignment at the end of week four at the Iron Yard. It was practice for multiple views in Django and an introduction to using Bootstrap css. I themed my site on some of my favorite trails in Vermont which I used to take guests on while I worked as a hiking guide.
